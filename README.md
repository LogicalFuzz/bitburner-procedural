## Bitburner using Procedural Programming

If you have never programmed before or are a novice or enthusiast, and would like to learn, this is where to start.

### What to Know and What You Will Learn
Procedural Programming is one of the oldest forms of programming and solidifies the basics of programming. You'll learn how to use:

* data types
* variables
* flow control
* functions
* libraries and imports
* basic data storage
* minor network communication

It is fairly standard to learn and get comfortable with all of these concepts before you proceed into other forms of programming such as Classical Object Oriented and Functional Programming.

### How to Use this Repository
This repository (repo) of code is split into branches based on objectives and steps. These objectives are covered, in video, by an accompanying video on YouTube. Each has its own branch. You can select the branch using the dropdown button on the top left. This is marked main if you are on the most recent branch. Click the dropdown and start at episode-1 to get started. It is highly recommended that for those serious about learning code

### What You Will NOT Learn
The goal of this video is not to teach perfect code. Like programming software, the primary goal is to get the work done and then improve on it after you've succeeded. As you progress, you will make smarter, more elegant code in a more organic manner.

### I've Finished!! What Next?
Consider playing the game by learning Classical Object-Oriented code. If you're in a more practical mood, you can look at my Web Programming. If you're feeling adventurous, you might try the game with Functional Programming. There will be separate repositories focusing on each of these.
